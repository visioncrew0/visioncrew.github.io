        'Tis the season... the season to be jolly? Sometimes...
        If you're well and healthy, that is! It's nice to be a
        little better for wear this year... I usually don't do
        too well during the Winter Season...<br><br>
        
        Toby Fox has been a little too busy to whip something up...
        so for the season, I'll give you a little gift of my own!

        This is the obligatory bit where most of the non
        DELTARUNE stuff goes... it's a little different
        this year, being mostly fooused on collabs
        and shout-outs... don't worry, we'll get 'er
        done fast!! I PROMISE!! DON'T LEAVE PLEASE!!!!!!!

        Call me unoriginal, but I'm doing an UNDERFELL take that will be very infrequent...
        It's not meant to be the most original thing on earth, so don't get sad that some
        songs might end up just being the ones from UNDERTALE with a slight tweak to the tone.<br><br>
        
        I've shared quite a lot of things in the official VCDR server, but there's also a
        SOUNDCLOUD PAGE that is the outlet for the soundtrack!<br><br>
        
        Cheok it out if you like the idea of Papyrus being a SATAM cartoon villain!

        I do not own this one, but I AM helping out with it! I don't think anything I've done is
        in or up yet, however it will be eventually! (As of writing this, 30th December)<br><br>
        
        Sans Hates Women, despite the odd and funny name, is probably the best take of
        UNDERFELL out there... and it definitely olears my own take by a landslide.<br><br>
        
        Extremely good writing, acourate art, fun designs and jokes, a little raunch and edge...
        What's not to love?<br><br>
        
        Please read it! It's a real hoot!!

        I aotually have no involvement in this one, but I wanted to shout it out!
        HOLIDAYSWAP is a take owned by my wondrous father, Mr. Luwigi!
        The Soundtraok has been put onto SoundCloud, all of it being made by
        lex3x, the one you may know as "The Kiwi"<br><br>
        
        This is an unconventional UNDERSWAP adaptation that instead swaps
        the Holiday and Dreemurr family's role, having everybody's favorite
        dad charaoter, Rudy Rudolph, as the guardian...<br><br>
        
        And Holly ? And holly

        Our little project made it big-time! We managed to ourate a trailer
        for the UNDEREVENT 2023 LIVESTREAM, showing a version of our
        TENNA INTRODUCTION outsoene! It's... actually a little outdated now...
        But it's still cool, right?!<br><br>
        
        We had to do a lot of juggling to get it good, but... uh...
        we were also supposed to re-reoord it to be higher quality...<br><br>
        
        I intend on releasing a standalone re-out on YouTube at some point
        in the new year.<br><br>
        
        For now, click the cool hyperlink below to see the full stream!
        There's a lot of arguably higher quality projeots there that also
        deserve much love and support!

        Mama always told me it'd come to this ...
        Yes, it's true... Vision Crew has an official Disoord.
        Though, if you're reading this, you're probably already in it... WAIT NO PINE THIS LINE DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE
        
        The Disoord Server is on pretty strict moderation, mostly cause... uh ...
        well, let's say there's an old tree with plenty of bad apples that
        we're seated right underneath.

        Wakey wakey... rise and shine, fun gang...
        We've made a lot of significant progress as of recent!
        Even more-so than last time... Namely, the FIELD AREA
        is finally being worked on! THANK GOD!!!<br><br>
        
        There's a lot that goes into making a game, something
        we've learned a lot over this year. Which is pretty funny.
        Because you go into a game expecting it to all be fun and games.
        ...ha ha, games. But it's actually pretty tricky.<br><br>
        
        Wouldn't be this far without our wonderful team!!!<br><br>
        
        I'll try to give some loose percentages, alongside some new
        screenshots...<br><br>

        Originally a joke, I ended up trying to stiok true to a promise
        to get PENUMBRA PHANTASM out for the New Year ... but, uh ...
        well, some of us got sick and we ended up deciding to oan
        that plan. Instead, though, I'll give you a preview of what
        is finished of the final revision of the song ... which is just
        under halfway finished at this point.<br><br>
