    Hard to believe 1t's already been one year since Vision Crew
    as a project started... I remember all the fun times.<br><br>
    ...Also the times where I accidentally...
    fooled, the entire internet.<br><br>

    But that's not important, today is a special day!
    It's a milestone, and we've really been getting
    things going on the game, so much so that I'd say
    it's FINALLY time to give people a scoop on
    what they can expect in the future..<br><br>

    This is likely going to be replacing the Status Update
    segments that I was doing on Tumblr before.
    Without further ado...<br>

    <div style="font-family: main-jve;letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%">LET'S GET THE SHOW STARTED!</div>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="font-family: main-bold; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">NON VISION CREW STUFF<br>hey... who cares about this?</div>
    <div class=underline_yellow></div>
    </p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
    Don't worry, I'll be keeping this segment short.
    I'm currently working on “SWAPSPIN”, which is an
    interpretation of an UNDERTALE AU.<br><br>

    Right now, the soundtrack is pretty far in.<br><br>

    I'm working on wrapping up the "Neutral Run" tracks
    at the moment. A lot of stuff is in progress.<br><br>

    I don't think most people care, but I'm going
    to share a funny piece of concept art.<br><br></p>

    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
    As well as that, I'd like to share
    a W.I.P from an upcoming SWAPSPIN track.</p>

    Anyway, it's time to move onto
    the more important stuff...<br><br>
    <div style="font-family: main-bold; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">Vision Crew's CHAPTER 3<br>progress update</div>
    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
    Vision Crew progress has been booming recently, due to our fantastic
    lead programmer, Tweenko, who's been doing a lot of heavy lifting.
    We've gotten a lot of things done recently that inch us
    closer, yet closer to being able to share something
    truly spectacular...<br><br>
    I'd like you all to look forward to things later this year,
    and early next year. We've got a lot planned for showcase.<br><br>

    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
    I'm very pleased to announce that CHAPTER 3's Soundtrack only has
    ane remaining track, which 1s completely original.<br>
    With the story making a lot of progress, I've finally capped off
    Just how much we're going to need.<br>
    I intend on potentially cutting the soundtrack down at some point,
    mostly due to CHAPTER 3 having the most songs so far...<br>
    I'll definitely be telling people in advance when and why
    a song 1s cut out of the project, but rest assured;
    Most of your favorites are probably fine.

    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
    Some more good news is:<br>
    WE'VE FINALLY RERCHED THE HALFWAY MARK OF
    CHAPTER 3'S SCRIPT!!
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/stupd-crowd.gif" alt="Crowd from the Sneaking Section." class="image"><br>
    The entire Chapter's main progression, up until
    the beginning of the Signal City, is completely written.
    Oesign-wise, very little has been added recently.
    With the Newsletter's introduction of the scrapped "sneaking" gimmick,
    we're going to be reusing some of that cut content here.
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/stupd-partysneak.gif" alt="Sneaking Kris, Susie, and Ralsei." class="image"><br>
    Though, it's likely a lot different to what Toby had planned.<br>
    We're going with something a lot shorter here.<br>
    For your eyes;<br>
    Here's a little gameplay sneak peek!<br>
    </p>

        This will be a short, closing section for this Hewsletter.
        A lot of things about CHAFTER 4 are finally being figured out.
        I haven't started on the script, but segments of dialog
        and key events are written down on paper...!<br><br>
        I'd like to introduce you to some faces you can expect
        to see during your rendezvous through Hometown.<br>
    </p>

    <br><img src="images/stupd-mayor.png" alt="Mayor C. lecturing Kris." class="image">
    <div style="font-family: main-bold; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">Mayor C.</div>
    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
        The leading political figure of Hometown, she's always busy.
        Very rarely leaving her office, The Mayor is strict and cold.<br><br>
        CHAPTER 4 has her informing the residents about their
        role in the preparation for the upcoming event;<br>
        The DARK FESTIVAL.<br><br>
    </p>

    <br><img src="images/stupd_onionsan.gif" alt="onionsan." class="image">
    <div style="font-family: main-bold; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">Onion</div>
    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
        Hum... hum... hum...<br><br>
    </p>

    <br><img src="images/stupd-snowy_mk.png" alt="Snowy And Monster Kid" class="image">
    <div style="font-family: main-bold; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">MK and Snowy</div>
    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
        The functional "antagonists" of this Chapter, MK and Snowy are
        two of Kris' classmates!<br> You've seen them in CHAPTER 1+2, but here
        they have an expanded role of really butting heads with Susie & Kris.<br>
        You'll fight them, deal with their vandalism, or Just talk it out,
        There's a lot to do...<br><br>
        MK is a nice kid, though.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <div style="font-family: main-bold; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 200%; color: yellow;">Closing Off</div>
    <div class=underline_yellow></div></p>
    <p style="display: inline-block; white-space: normal; width: 600px;">
        I think there is NOBODY left to mention, so this'll be
        where we cap things off for this anniversary.<br>
        It's been an honor working amongst such a huge number of
        talented artists, musicians and game designers.<br><br>

        I hope things can remain fruitful and strong for
        years to comel! Until the game is finished, at least...<br><br>

        Thank you for reading this little Newsletter!
        More info will come soon.<br><br>
